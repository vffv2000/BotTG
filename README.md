# BotTG
This Python project uses the libraries telebot, requests, random, yaml, types (imported from telebot), and sleep to create a Telegram bot that provides weather information and additional features.
Users can send requests to the bot to get the current weather in a specific city. The bot uses API requests to a weather service to obtain up-to-date information and display it on the screen.
The bot also has an administrator panel that allows the administrator to manage bot functions, such as sending messages to users or changing bot settings.
Additionally, the bot can use API requests to obtain photos of random cats or dogs and send them to the user.
Overall, this project creates a multifunctional Telegram bot that provides weather information and has additional capabilities.
